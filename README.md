# Project Summary

The goal of the project was to utilize twitter API to extract tweets and utlize lift analyses and sentiment analyses to paint a picture of the publics (twitter users) political leanings within their respective states. 

The dataset was made of 8,142 tweets all of which had clean location data. The swing states were the primary focus of the project. The key words used were "Tax, Russia, Covid, Administration, Campaign, Scandal" in order to get an idea of user perceptions of #Biden and #Trump.

To conclude we developed a visual of the swing states, and what the data appears to predict is the sentiment of each swing state. The only toss up our analyses found was North Carolina. After elections completed it appears that Trump barely won by 1.34%
